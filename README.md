# KALINUX SECURITY
  
 ## My collection of basic, i mean, beginner-friendly and available and i would say required tools, features, set ups to know how to.

  ### Is it advanced guide from noob guider?

  Well, partly. I will say not truth if i say that i cyber guru or etc.
    Feel free to edit my configs, correct me if i wrong somewhere.  
                
  I just decided to get and collect every tool, set up or feature i know and descrbe here in details, some kind of tutorial or guide, mostly for me personally. I so happy that i can now easily get nginx cinfigs. which are 1. works; 2. Secure; 3. Free.
   So, if you  want something really good but cheap (if we speak about money) - do it by yourself

   But i will happy if someone will find it useful of course. Ir is also a reason i call it noob guide - because i will describe what every little part mean and do. For a notice - I was at 0lvl or under less than year ago. So yes, i was got to learn     alot, really damn a lot, and still have to. But i got thesee skills self-practising and reading tons of docs, you will get it by understandable text and much faster.
